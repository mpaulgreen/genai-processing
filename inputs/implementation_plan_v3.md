PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
- Query complexity scoring (Low <20, Medium 20-50, High >50 points)
- Automatic performance warnings for complex queries
- Resource usage limits and monitoring
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete README.md for every package
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Usage examples and best practices
- Performance guidelines and optimization tips

README UPDATES:
- Update main project README.md
- Update all package-level README.md files
- Create missing documentation files
- Include comprehensive examples and usage guidelines

If any component performance optimization affects functionality, update corresponding test cases. If any tests are failing, fix those failing test cases. The system must maintain high performance while supporting all functional requirements.
